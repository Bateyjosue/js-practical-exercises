## Question 1: Counting Zeros

```
Count Total number of zeros from 1 up to n?
Explanation: So the trick here is. if you have a number 1 to 50 the value is 5. just 50 divided by 10. However, if the value is 100. The value is 11. you will get by 100/10 = 10 and 10/10. That's how you will get in the more zeros in one number like (100, 200, 1000)
```

## Question 2: Greatest Common Divisor
```
How would you find the greatest common divisor of two numbers?

```

## Question 3: Remove Duplicate
```
How would you remove duplicate members from an array without Set?

```

## Question 4: Reverse in  place
```
If you have a string like "I am the good boy". How can you generate "I ma eht doog yob"? Please note that the words are in place but reversed.
```

## Question 5: Add numbers
```
You are given a mathematical expression as a string, which may contain numbers, operators, and parentheses. Your task is to evaluate the expression and return the result.


Rules:
The expression will follow operator precedence, where multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction.
Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence.
The expression may contain spaces, which should be ignored.


calculateExpression("5 + 4 * 3 / 2 - 1"); // should return 10
calculateExpression("( 2 + 3 ) * ( 4 - 1 )"); // should return 15

Note: You can assume that the input expression will always be valid and well-formed. Eval is not allowed for this question.
